# Simulated-SQL-Assessments

These are a collection of sql assessments simulating real world business cases. A sample data set will be generated along with required DDL statements. 

The SQL challenges will typically range from easy to hard. 

## Industry: E-Commerce

We will mimic a real-world business case for an e-commerce platform. The dataset will represent the following tables:
	1.	Customers: Information about the customers.
	2.	Products: Details of the products available for purchase.
	3.	Orders: Records of customer purchases.
