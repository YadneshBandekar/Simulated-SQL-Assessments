## Challenge 1: Revenue by Vehicle Type

### Objective
Identify the total revenue generated by each vehicle type for completed deliveries in February 2023.

### Query Walkthrough
1. Use the `logistics.fleet` and `logistics.deliveries` tables.
2. Join these tables on `VehicleID`.
3. Filter for deliveries in February 2023 (`DeliveryDate` between '2023-02-01' and '2023-03-01').
4. Group data by `VehicleType` and calculate total revenue using `SUM(Revenue)`.

### Solution
```sql
SELECT  
    F.VehicleType,
    SUM(D.Revenue) AS Revenue
FROM logistics.fleet F 
LEFT JOIN logistics.deliveries D 
    ON F.VehicleID = D.VehicleID
WHERE D.DeliveryDate >= '2023-02-01' AND D.DeliveryDate < '2023-03-01'
GROUP BY F.VehicleType
ORDER BY Revenue DESC;
```
